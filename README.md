# Odin Recipes

📚 **Foundations Course Project — The Odin Project**

## 📌 Description

**Odin Recipes** is a practice project built as part of the Foundations course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Its main goal is to strengthen basic HTML skills by creating a simple multi-page website with recipes.

The project consists of a homepage (`index.html`) containing links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a dish image, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — basic structure and content
- **Git** / **GitHub** — version control and hosting
- **GitHub Pages** — publishing the project online

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Building standard HTML page structure (boilerplate)
- Working with relative links and multi-page navigation
- Creating ordered and unordered lists
- Embedding images in a webpage
- Managing folders and project file structure
- Using Git and GitHub (cloning, committing, pushing)
- Publishing websites with GitHub Pages
